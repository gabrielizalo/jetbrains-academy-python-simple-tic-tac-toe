# Project: Simple Tic-Tac-Toe

### About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood:
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single
mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough
that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program
Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!


###  Learning outcomes

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning
and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling
errors, and processing user input.
